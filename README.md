Optimized Selenium Chromedriver patch which does not trigger anti-bot services like Distill Network / Imperva / DataDome / Botprotect.io
Automatically downloads the driver binary and patches it.

* Tested until current chrome beta versions
* Works also on Brave Browser and many other Chromium based browsers, but you need to know what you're doing and needs some tweaking.
* Python 3.6++**
